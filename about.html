			<h3>A break from the city blues.</h3>
			<p>If you are starting to feel that there are no options for nature lovers in Guwahati and the vicinity to break free and feel the fresh air brushing across your face and hear the chirping and humming of birds and bees or just simply to take an hour and a half drive from the heart of the city to spend a day far from the maddening crowd...then picture this -</p>

					<p><b>About a 60 kms distance from the busy Paltan Bazar railway station and 40 kms from the LGBI airport, and surrounded by the lush hills and mountains of Assam and Meghalaya and  amidst a scintillating natural landscape lies the largest lake of Assam - Chandubi...</p>
	  
					<p>Beside the octopus shaped lake surrounded by the range of mesmerizing green hills lays a quite forest village on the bank naturally bordered with groves of tall Sal trees...</p>

					<p>The roar of traffic and the humdrum of city life is long forgotten with the absence of any mechanical sound to break the calm but rather enlivened by the careless chatter of Hollock Gibbon, chirpings of numerous Parrots and other kinds of birds...</p>

					<p>A village to give respite to the wary traveler from the sweltering summer heat with a cool breezy ambience to soothe your body and mind, as you walk around the place and lose yourself amidst the untouched beauty of nature...</b></p>

			<p>All these and much more are in store for the globetrotter and nature lovers all around the year as Wave Eco Tourism brings to you the Chandubi Eco Camp in a bid to welcome you to a place unadulterated with the stressful trappings of a city life and offer you a date with the less complicated pleasures of life amidst pristine nature!</p>
	  
			<p>Chandubi was known for years now as a popular picnic spot near Guwahati. But in 2009, with the initiative of a group called Wave Eco-Tourism, Chandubi has been harnessed to be more than just a crowdy picnic-spot. Eco tourism was introduced in the region and today it has established itself as a significant sector for eco-tourism.</p>

			<p>Near the bank of the Chandubi lake lies the Joramukhia forest village comprising of about 20 families of the Rabha tribe. Apart from the presence of the 100 inhabitants of the village, no other human habitation exists neither any sound could be heard in the entire stretch of land. The only mechanical intrusion once in a while, is the sound of the aeroplane flying overhead the region. The stillness and quietness of the area is filled with the occasional symphony of sound created by the multitude species of birds that offers a wonderful opportunity to bird-watch and a pleasure to photograph. The lake is also the resting ground for elephants that are found in herds enjoying the calm waters of the lake indulging in a bathing or cooling spree. Fauna like porcupine, bear, bon row, lota mekuri, five different species of monkeys, fish of various shapes and colours, and abundant medicinal plants are also found in the region.</p>

			<p>So, its time now to pack your bags and put on your trekking shoes to spend a day in the Chandubi Eco Camp for an eventful experience. And to top it all you can also feast on a nutritiously sumptuous meal of ethnic food prepared by the expert hands of the Rabha women of the Joramukhia village during your stay, which is sure to provide a lasting memory for a lifetime.</p>

			<p>With all of these on the platter, if you are game enough to steal a day or a night from a year's calendar to come and soak yourself in the nature rich atmosphere of Chandubi...we bet you won't ever regret taking this break from the city blues! </p>
